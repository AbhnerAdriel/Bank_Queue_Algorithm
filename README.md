# Bank_Queue_Algorithm
<p>
    A practical application of the linked list and queue concepts made through the C++ language.
</p>

<p>
  The program simulates, at the same time, two real bank lines: the access line for all audiences, as well as the preferential line, restricted to a certain class. 
</p>

<p>
  In this program, it is possible to manipulate the number of tokens in each queue as well as manage them based on the idea of FIFO (First In, First Out).
